%% To be able to get parsed, the input must follow these rules:
%% - each reaction rate/species/reaction should be written into one line
%% - the set of reaction rates/species/reactions should be framed by a header and tailer as in the example below
%% - the reactions should be framed with quotation marks
%% - the reactions should have a space between every species, coefficient, '+' and reaction sign
%% - after the reactions, the reaction rate symbol for the forward and backward reaction should be written in a second and third column, respectively

%% reaction rates start
ka
kd
%% reaction rates end

%% species start
A
B
C
%% species end

%% reactions start
"A + B <=> C"	ka	kd
%% reactions end
