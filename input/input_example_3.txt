%% To be able to get parsed, the input must follow these rules:
%% - each reaction rate/species/reaction should be written into one line
%% - the set of reaction rates/species/reactions should be framed by a header and tailer as in the example below
%% - the reactions should be framed with quotation marks
%% - the reactions should have a space between every species, coefficient, '+' and reaction sign
%% - after the reactions, the reaction rate symbol for the forward and backward reaction should be written in a second and third column, respectively

%% reaction rates start
kon1p
kon2p
kon3p
kon2n
kon3n
koff1
koff2
koff3
%% reaction rates end

%% species start
L
R
C1
C2
C3
%% species end

%% reactions start (reaction within quotation marks, forwarding and backwarding reaction constants after that, respectively)
"L + R <=> C1"	kon1p	koff1
"C1 => C2"	kon2p	kon2n
"C2 => C3"	kon3p	kon3n
"C2 => L + R"	koff2	-
"C3 => L + R"	koff3	-
%% reactions end
