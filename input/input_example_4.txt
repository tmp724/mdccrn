%% To be able to get parsed, the input must follow these rules:
%% - each reaction rate/species/reaction should be written into one line
%% - the set of reaction rates/species/reactions should be framed by a header and tailer as in the example below
%% - the reactions should be framed with quotation marks
%% - the reactions should have a space between every species, coefficient, '+' and reaction sign
%% - after the reactions, the reaction rate symbol for the forward and backward reaction should be written in a second and third column, respectively

%% reaction rates start
ka1
ka2
ka3
ka4
ka5
kd1
kd2
kd3
kd4
kd5
%% reaction rates end

%% species start
IL6
IL6sgp80
gp80
gp130
IL6gp80
IL6gp80gp130
IL6sgp80gp130
%% species end

%% reactions start (reaction within quotation marks, forwarding and backwarding reaction constants after that, respectively)
"IL6            +       gp80    <=>     IL6gp80"        ka1     kd1
"IL6gp80                +       gp130   <=>     IL6gp80gp130"   ka2     kd2
"IL6sgp80       +       gp130   <=>     IL6sgp80gp130"  ka5     kd5
%% reactions end
